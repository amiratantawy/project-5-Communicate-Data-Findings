## Dataset


I choose Ford GoBike bike ride data from 2018/01 to 2019/02 for my project. The data was downloaded from here https://www.fordgobike.com/system-data. The data is about bike ride date, station information, member type, gender and age.


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, I found that there are two types of clients using the system: subscribers who are mainly daily commuters, having short trips to and from work, who rent a bike on weekdays at 8-9am and 5-6pm, and, occasionally around the lunch time, and customers, usually tourists or occassional riders who use the system mainly on weekends to explore the Bay Area. The bike share system was used more often around summertime (May-October) with a clear drop from January to March, most probably due to the weather condition. Moreover, I have checked if there are some differences in trends for genders. In most cases the trend for males/females was the same, except of the fact that females tend to have slightly longer trips and suprisingly, for casual users there are quite a lot of females using the system between January and March in comparison to males (the ratio is much smaller than for the rest of the year).

## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the influence of age, timeframe, weekday, age group of bike hiring data. I start by introducing the age distrubition, monthly bike hiring trend, followed by age group distribution, then plot the weekday, timeframe with age data.  I tried to use different color palettes for each variables to make sure it is clear and to ber interested that they're different between each other.
